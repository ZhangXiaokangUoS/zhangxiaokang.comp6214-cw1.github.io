Final results, Wave 3 of ONS Business Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Survey that are either continuing to trade or who have temporarily paused or ceased trading.Real Estate Services, Other Services and Mining and Quarrying have been removed due to their low response rate, but their totals are included in ‘All Industries’.

For example, though the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme went live on 20th April, businesses could still indicate whether they had applied or received this scheme.* percentage less than 1%. ";
